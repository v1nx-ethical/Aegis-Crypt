🎮 Basic Usage Tutorial
🏁 Getting Started
Launch the Application

bash
python v1nxencoder.py
Initial Setup

Application creates data/ and logs/ directories automatically

Generates initial cryptographic keys

Starts real-time system monitoring

🔐 Basic Encryption/Decryption
Step 1: Text Encryption
Navigate to 🔐 Encryption tab

Select algorithm: AES-256-GCM (recommended for beginners)

Enter plaintext in the Input area

Click 🚀 Encrypt

Copy the generated key from the Current Key field

Save both the encrypted output and the key securely

Step 2: Text Decryption
Paste encrypted JSON data into Input area

Paste the encryption key into Current Key field

Click 🔓 Decrypt

View decrypted text in Output area

Example Workflow:
python
# Encryption
Plaintext: "This is a secret message"
→ Encrypt with AES-256-GCM
→ Output: JSON with ciphertext, nonce, algorithm
→ Key: "q4t7w9z$C&F)J@NcRfUjXn2r5u8x/A?D"

# Decryption  
Encrypted JSON + Key → Decrypt → Original plaintext
🔑 Key Management
Generating New Keys
Go to 🔑 Key Management tab

Click ➕ Generate New

Enter key name: "Master-Encryption-Key"

Select type: AES

Choose algorithm: 256-GCM

Click Generate

Managing Existing Keys
View: All keys displayed in the table

Refresh: Click 🔄 Refresh to update list

Delete: Select key, click 🗑️ Delete Selected

⚔️ Advanced Features
🔥 Offensive Operations
Ransomware Simulation
bash
# WARNING: Use only on test files in isolated environments
1. Navigate to ⚔️ Offensive tab
2. Click "Browse Target" and select a test file
3. Click "Encrypt Target"
4. Observe ransom note creation
5. Use provided recovery key for decryption testing
Network Reconnaissance
In ⚔️ Offensive tab, click Network Recon

View network interfaces and local IP information

Click Port Scan to scan localhost (127.0.0.1)

Analyze open ports and services

Secure File Wiping
Select target file in ⚔️ Offensive tab

Click Secure Wipe

Confirm permanent deletion

File is overwritten with multiple patterns (DOD 5220.22-M compliant)

👻 Stealth Operations
Memory-Only Mode
Currently simulated (full implementation requires advanced OS integration)

Data processed in RAM when possible

Minimal disk writing for operational security

Data Obfuscation
Enter data in stealth tab text area

Click Obfuscate Data

Observe multi-layer transformation (XOR + Base85)

Use Deobfuscate Data to reverse

📊 System Monitoring

🚨 Security Considerations
🔒 Operational Security
bash
# Best Practices for Safe Usage
1. ✅ Use in isolated virtual machines
2. ✅ Test only on authorized systems
3. ✅ Maintain proper access controls
4. ✅ Monitor system for unexpected behavior
5. ✅ Keep comprehensive activity logs
⚠️ Risk Mitigation
Data Loss: Always backup files before testing encryption features

Detection: Some features may trigger antivirus software (expected)

Persistence: Use responsibly - some features create system entries

Legal: Ensure all testing is authorized and documented

🔐 Cryptographic Security
AES-256-GCM: Authenticated encryption providing confidentiality and integrity

RSA-2048: Secure key exchange and digital signatures

Key Management: Secure storage with optional stealth features

Randomness: Cryptographically secure random number generation

🆘 Troubleshooting
Common Issues and Solutions
❌ "Application failed to start"
Problem: Missing dependencies or Python version issues
Solution:

bash
# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Reinstall dependencies
pip uninstall cryptography psutil
pip install cryptography psutil

# Check for system libraries (Linux)
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev
❌ "Admin privileges required"
Problem: Some features need elevated permissions
Solution:

bash
# Windows: Run as Administrator
# Linux: Use sudo (if absolutely necessary)
# Better: Configure proper permissions for testing environment
❌ Antivirus Detection
Problem: Security software flags the application
Solution:

Add exclusion for project directory

Use in isolated testing environment

This is expected behavior for security tools

❌ GUI Not Loading
Problem: Tkinter issues or display problems
Solution:

bash
# Install tkinter (Linux)
sudo apt install python3-tk

# Windows: Reinstall Python with Tkinter support
Performance Optimization
Slow Encryption/Decryption
Ensure AES-NI support enabled in BIOS

Close unnecessary applications

Use AES-256-GCM for better performance than RSA

High Memory Usage
Application typically uses 50-150MB RAM

Monitor background processes

Restart application if memory grows excessively
