## Welcome to Aegis-Crypt!
---
Aegis-Crypt was just a fun project that I thought would be nice to code it has strong encryption methods and maybe stuff you'd be interested in. It has advanced gui/ui (User friendly) you don't have to be a "master coder" to use this tool! You can be a skid and just have fun with it! It simulates ransomware methods while encrypting text. This project was oringinally coded in python, it has two versions. The windows executables (You may be interested in) or the full python package. I wish you guys the best and I always love feed back and how I can possibly improve in my coding skills!
