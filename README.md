Common Installation Issues
Python Environment Problems
Issue: Python not found or wrong version
Solution:

bash
# Check Python version
python --version
# Should be 3.8 or higher

# If multiple Python versions, use specific version
python3 --version
py -3.9 --version  # Windows specific
Issue: pip command not found
Solution:

bash
# On Linux/macOS
python3 -m ensurepip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# On Windows
py -m ensurepip
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
Cryptography Module Installation
Issue: Cryptography installation fails on Windows
Solution:

bash
# Install Visual C++ Build Tools or
pip install cryptography --no-binary cryptography

# Alternative: Use pre-compiled wheels
pip install cryptography-3.4.8-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
Issue: Cryptography installation fails on Linux
Solution:

bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install gcc openssl-devel libffi-devel python3-devel
sudo dnf install gcc openssl-devel libffi-devel python3-devel

# Then install cryptography
pip install cryptography
Tkinter Issues
Issue: Tkinter not available
Solution:

bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install tkinter
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# macOS
brew install python-tk
# or reinstall Python from python.org

# Windows - Usually included, if not reinstall Python
Runtime Errors
Database Connection Issues
Issue: "Unable to open database file"
Solution:

python
import os
# Create data directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('data', mode=0o700, exist_ok=True)

# Check permissions
import stat
os.chmod('data', stat.S_IRWXU)

# Verify the path is writable
import tempfile
test_file = os.path.join('data', 'test_write')
try:
    with open(test_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write('test')
    os.remove(test_file)
    print("Directory is writable")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Directory not writable: {e}")
Issue: "Database is locked"
Solution:

python
# Check for multiple instances
import psutil
current_pid = os.getpid()
for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'cmdline']):
    try:
        if 'main.py' in ' '.join(proc.info['cmdline'] or []) and proc.info['pid'] != current_pid:
            print(f"Another instance found: PID {proc.info['pid']}")
            proc.terminate()
    except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, psutil.AccessDenied):
        pass
Permission Denied Errors
Issue: File operation permission errors
Solution:

bash
# Check current directory permissions
ls -la

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 Aegis-Crypt
chmod 600 data/*.db 2>/dev/null

# Run from user home directory if system directory has restrictions
cd ~
mkdir my_aegis
cd my_aegis
# Copy your files here and run
Issue: Network operation permission errors
Solution:

bash
# On Linux, may need to run with appropriate capabilities
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw+ep' $(which python3)

# Or run with appropriate privileges (not recommended long-term)
sudo python3 main.py
Performance Issues
Slow Encryption Operations
Symptoms: Encryption takes much longer than expected
Solutions:

Check System Resources:

python
import psutil
print(f"CPU: {psutil.cpu_percent()}%")
print(f"Memory: {psutil.virtual_memory().percent}%")
print(f"Disk: {psutil.disk_usage('.').percent}%")
Optimize Settings:

python
# Reduce chunk size for memory-constrained systems
PERFORMANCE_CONFIG['chunk_size'] = 4096  # 4KB instead of 64KB

# Disable compression if enabled
PERFORMANCE_CONFIG['compression_enabled'] = False

# Reduce concurrent operations
PERFORMANCE_CONFIG['max_concurrent_operations'] = 1
Close Background Applications:

Close unnecessary applications

Stop background processes

Ensure adequate free memory

High Memory Usage
Symptoms: Application using excessive memory
Solutions:

Enable Streaming Mode:

python
# For file operations, use streaming instead of loading entire file
with open('large_file.txt', 'rb') as f:
    while chunk := f.read(65536):  # 64KB chunks
        process_chunk(chunk)
Adjust Buffer Sizes:

python
# Reduce buffer sizes
PERFORMANCE_CONFIG['file_buffer_size'] = 4096  # 4KB
PERFORMANCE_CONFIG['memory_cache_size'] = 67108864  # 64MB
Force Garbage Collection:

python
import gc
gc.collect()  # Manually trigger garbage collection
Debug Mode
For detailed troubleshooting, enable debug mode:

python
import logging
import sys

# Enable debug logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('debug.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    ]
)

# Enable cryptography debug
import cryptography
cryptography.__version__  # Check version for compatibility
Common Error Messages and Solutions
Error: "No module named 'cryptography'"

Solution: pip install cryptography

Error: "TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable"

Solution: This is a Linux GUI issue. Use export DISPLAY=:0 or run on a system with GUI

Error: "sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file"

Solution: Check directory permissions and create 'data' directory

Error: "PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied"

Solution: Run from user directory or adjust permissions

Error: "MemoryError" during large file operations

Solution: Use smaller chunk sizes or process files in segments
