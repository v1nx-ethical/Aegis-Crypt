Welcome to Aegis-Crypt!

Aegis-Crypt started as a fun side project with a simple goal: build something cool with strong encryption methods that anyone can enjoy. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just exploring, this tool is designed to be user-friendly and accessible.
🔐 Key Features:
• 	Simulates ransomware-style encryption (for educational purposes)
• 	Encrypts text with strong algorithms
• 	Advanced GUI/UI for smooth interaction
• 	No need to be a "master coder" — just dive in and explore
💻 Versions Available:
• 	Windows Executable — plug-and-play for quick use
• 	Full Python Package — for those who want to dig into the code
I built this in Python and I'm always open to feedback. If you’ve got ideas, suggestions, or just want to say hi — I’d love to hear from you!
